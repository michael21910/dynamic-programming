# Dynamic Programming Implementation
Implement some problems using dynamic programming.  

## Solved problems
* [Fibonacci sequence](fibonacci_sequence/fibonacci_sequence.cpp)
    * Enter a number n, may get an output fib(n).
* [Grid Traveler Problem](grid_traveler/grid_traveler.cpp)
    * A person starts from the position (0, 0), after the input (row, col), may get output of the ways to get from (0, 0) to the user input, the person can only go right or down. 
* [Can Sum Problem](canSum/canSum.cpp)  
    * Determine the number that the user input can be subtract to 0 by a set of numbers that the user input, return true if it is possible, false if isn't.
